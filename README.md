# Winter Break Project

    The winter break will likely have your first experience with stepping away from coding long enough to feel a little disoriented when you come back to it. Keep in mind that it's important to strike the balance between going cold turkey on coding and burning out from self-prescribed three-day hackathons.

    The goal of this project is to give you something to work on over the break and to interact with your fellow students while we are out of class.

### GitHub Class Room process with React

- clone the Echo-2021-Winter-Project repository with your username attached to it
- cd into the repository
- Create a new branch for the user story you are working on: story-initials (ex. create-react-app-aw)
- Create a new React application with no spaces: yarn create react-app lightbulb-student1 (ex. yarn create react-app lightbulb-austin)
- cd into the project
- Open the project in a text editor
- Create a directory in src called components
- Create a directory in src called assets
- Code!

Useful Commands
```
$ yarn create react-app app-name
$ yarn start
ctrl + c (stops the server)
ctrl + t (opens a new terminal tab)
```
## Light Bulb Challenge
This challenge has three pieces: The Code, Code Reviews, and a Presentation.

## The Code 
This part challenge is broken into user stories to help you divide up the work of a project like you would at internship or on a dev team. 

### Light Bulb User Stories
- As a user, I can see my React App running on my screen. (branch name: create-react-app-initials)  
    
- As a user, I can see a square on the screen with the word "off" in the middle. (branch name: square-initials)

- As a user, when I click the square the word toggle from "off" to "on" and then back "off" again. (branch name: on-off-initials)

- As a user, when I click the box the color goes from white to yellow. The words "on" or "off" are still displayed in the box. (branch name: colors-initials)
  
- As a user, instead of seeing a box, I see a picture of a light switch in the "off" position. (branch name: onclick-off-initials)
  
- As a user, when I click on the light switch it turns "on". (branch name: onclick-on-initials)
  
- As a user, when the light switch is "off", I see a white light bulb. (branch name: onclick-off-lightbulb-initials)
  
- As a user, when I turn the switch "on", I see a yellow light bulb. (branch name: onclick-on-lightbulb-initials)


### Stretch Challenge

- As a user, I can see two buttons: 1) Add a Light Switch and 2) Remove a Light Switch. (branch name: add-remove-initials)

- As a user, when I click the Add button I can another Light Switch with its accompanying Light Bulb. (branch name: add-initials)

- As a user, when I see multiple Light Switch/Light Bulb combinations, they all operate independently of each other. (branch name: component-map-initials)

- As a user, when I click the Remove button I can delete a Light Switch with its accompanying Light Bulb. (branch name: remove-initials)

### Light Bulb Git Hub Process 
Important! 
Each user story will be correlated to a branch (naming convention provided above). 
Once you are complete with each story of coding you will:
    - Push your code up to your repository
    - Create a Pull Request for the branch that is complete
    - Post a link of this Pull Request in the slack 2021e Channel
    - Tag classmates or instructors to review your code 
    - Once your code has been reviewed and accepted 
    - Merge your PR and delete the old branch from GitHub
    - Checkout the next branch on your local repository (hint: always checkout new branches from main after pulling main)
    - Keep coding!

In the event no one is able to review your code you are welcome to preform your own review and merge the PR. 

## Code Review 
Each person will be responsible for reviewing three Pull Requests of their classmates. This includes checking their code for: 
- Functionality
- Proper syntax
- Pseudo Code
- Formatting and Indentation
&
- Make sure that the associated branch matches the work that is done.

and lastly 
## The Presentation

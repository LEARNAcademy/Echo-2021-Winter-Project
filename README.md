# Winter Break Project

The winter break will likely have your first experience with stepping away from coding long enough to feel a little disoriented when you come back to it. Keep in mind that it's important to strike the balance between going cold turkey on coding and burning out from self-prescribed three-day hackathons.

The goal of this project is to give you something to work on over the break and to interact with your fellow students while we are out of class.

### GitHub Classroom process with React

- clone the Echo-2021-Winter-Project repository with your username attached to it
- cd into the repository
- Create a new branch for the user story you are working on(ex. Setup-off-on)
- Create a new React application with no spaces in the name: yarn create react-app lightbulb
- cd into the project
- Open the project in a text editor
- Create a directory in src called components
- Create a directory in src called assets
- Code!

Useful Commands
```
$ yarn create react-app app-name
$ yarn start
ctrl + c (stops the server)
ctrl + t (opens a new terminal tab)
```
## Light Bulb Challenge
This challenge has three pieces: 
1. The Code: A React project.
2. Code Reviews: Developing a new skill that is valuable in Development field.
3. Show and Tell: A short presentation about your experiance with the project. 

# The Code 
This part of the challenge is broken into sections to help you understand the goal and scope of the project. Your job is to break these sections down into smaller managable pieces. The indurstry standard is to turn ideas into user stories: (ex. "As a user, I can see a button that turns red when I click it"). Part of this project will require research into react assets. 

**Branch names have been given for each of the larger sections. These are the only branches you should need to use.**

### Light Bulb User Stories
    
Branch Name : Setup-off-on

- I can see my React App running on my screen. On my screen, I can see a square on the screen with the word "off" in the middle. When I click the square the word toggle from "off" to "on" and then back "off" again. When I click the box the color goes from white to yellow. The words "on" or "off" are still displayed in the box. 

Branch Name : assets-switch

- Instead of seeing a box, I see a picture of a light switch in the "off" position. When I click on the light switch it turns "on". 

Branch Name : assets-bulb

- When the light switch is "off", I see a white light bulb. When I turn the switch "on", I see a yellow light bulb. 


### Stretch Challenge

Branch Name : stretch-challenges

- I can see two buttons, add a Light Switch and remove a Light Switch. When I click the Add button I can another Light Switch with its accompanying Light Bulb. When I see multiple Light Switch/Light Bulb combinations, they all operate independently of each other. When I click the Remove button I can delete a Light Switch with its accompanying Light Bulb. 

### Light Bulb Git Hub Process 
Important! 

Once you are complete with each story of coding you will:
1. Push your code up to your repository
2. Create a Pull Request for the branch that is complete
3. Post a link of this Pull Request in the slack 2021e Channel
4. Tag classmates or instructors to review your code 
5. Once your code has been reviewed and accepted 
6. Merge your PR and delete the old branch from GitHub
7. Checkout the next branch on your local repository (hint: always checkout new branches from main after pulling main)
8. Keep coding!

Be mindful to promptly pushing your code for assignments because **your peers will need time to read your code and provide feedback in a timely manner**



# Code Review 
Building your code reviewer muscle as a web developer is an important skill. Know that your input, at any level, is valuable. Code reviewing gives you the opportunity to read code and understand all the things that go into making code beautiful.

Each person will be responsible for reviewing three Pull Requests of their classmates. This includes checking their code for: 
- Functionality
- Proper syntax
- Pseudo Code
- Formatting and Indentation
&
- Make sure that the associated branch matches the work that is done.


## Code Review Code of Conduct
- [LEARN Code of Conduct](https://www.learnacademy.org/code-of-conduct/)
- [Optional Reading: Code Review Code of Conduct](https://medium.com/front-end-weekly/code-reviews-code-of-conduct-6c78a026ed35)
  
- **Goal: Provide feedback that may help the author's code be more legible and performant, easy to read, and uses best practices. If the code is outstanding, leave comments that indicate what you appreciated about it.**
  
- Be respectful. Code is personal because people have worked very hard on it, exercise humbleness in your feedback. Be suggestive, not decisive.
  
- **General expectation of minimum three comments on each Github pull request.**

### Code Review Checklist
Consider improvements that can be made to: 
- Variable naming: Are they descriptive and accurate? If not, what is an example of a fitting name? Does it help with understanding the code?
- Formatting: Is it helping or hurting your ability to understand the code quickly?
- Comments: Are they helpful and accurate? 
- Logic: Is there another way to achieve the same behavior? What are the pros and cons of doing it that way?
- Compliments: What does the code do well?


## How to: Code Review
1. When a classmate posts a link for a code review in slack add an emoji of the :eyes: (aka Taking-a-look) to the post. 
2. On the PR page there is a tab called "files changed" 
3. This tab should have a record of all the code changes made to the branch.
4. Leave comments on the code it by pressing the "+" button that appears next to the code line number
5. Throughly review the code
6. When you are done click the "Finish your review" green button at the top right of the page. This will open a text box where you can leave general feedback and notes. Either "Approve" the PR or "Comment".
7. If you have approved the PR on slack 2021e leave a :white-check-mark: (aka completed) emoji on the post. 
8. If you did not approve but did leave a comment on the code: leave a comment on the slack post "left a comment for you in Github" 


# The Show and Tell
Prepare a three-minute show and tell for the cohort. Pick one or two of the following topics to help structure your presentation.

Topics

- Talk about errors you encountered in your Lightbulb challenge. Show the error message. Discuss your solution.

- Where/how did you find it? What did you learn?

- Talk about comments that you left on your code reviews. Why did you feel these comments were important? What was your experience in providing feedback?

- Talk about new vocabulary word(s) you learned/relearned and encountered while working on projects. These can be words you are familiar with in layman's terms but are used differently in the software/web development context or words that are completely new to you.

- Talk about refactoring you did. Show your commits. Why were these changes important? What problem(s) were you trying you solve?
